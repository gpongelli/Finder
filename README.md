Finder
===============
*Finder* is a very advanced search platform for Joomla! 1.5

Goal
===============
The goal is to migrate *Finder* to be Joomla! 1.7+ compatible for inclusion in a future release of the CMS.

Getting Started
===============
There are two ways to get started using Finder:

Easy:
* Click the Downloads button at the top of the page and download the newest posted package (listed by date)

Advanced:
* Clone the repo to your local system
* Run 'phing dev_head' to create an installable package based on the current repo

Contributing
===============
* If you've found issues or have feature requests, add them to the issue tracker @ https://github.com/Finder-Integration/Finder/issues
* If you have code to contribute fixing any issues, fork the repo, make your changes, and issue a pull request
